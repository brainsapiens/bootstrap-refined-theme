# ![Refined](examples/logo.svg) Bootstrap Refined Theme

Despite the fact that the title contains the word &laquo;theme&raquo;&nbsp;&mdash; it&nbsp;is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;basic Bootstrap, only carefully, lovingly and minimally _refined_ to&nbsp;look better than the basic version.

Theme consists of&nbsp;2&nbsp;styles: [Strict](examples/strict.html) and [Smooth](examples/smooth.html), where you can find detailed description of&nbsp;all changes with examples. Choose which styling is&nbsp;more suitable for you.

The theme is building within fork of Bootstrap source code, so you can track the changes in the source code [here](https://github.com/brainsapiens/bootstrap/commits/bootstrap-refined-theme).
